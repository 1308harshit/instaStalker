          <p>
            Once an order is successfully placed and payment is confirmed, the
            order is considered final and is immediately moved into processing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Customers are advised to review all information carefully before
            completing their purchase.

            Cancellations are not permitted once an order has been placed and
            processing has begun.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are unable to cancel, modify, or reverse orders after
            confirmation due to the nature of our order processing workflow.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>3. Refund Eligibility</h2>

            <li>
              Payment was successfully completed but the order was not processed

            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
