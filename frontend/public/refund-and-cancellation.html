          <h2>Refund Policy</h2>
          <p>Refunds for services purchased on the Platform are governed by the following terms:</p>
          <p>Refund requests will be considered only if the user has genuinely not received the purchased digital service. The request must be raised within 3 days from the date of successful payment. Each refund request is carefully reviewed to verify service non-delivery before approval.</p>
          <p>Once a digital service has been successfully delivered, activated, accessed, or confirmed via the registered email ID of the user, no refund shall be applicable. Refunds will also not be provided in cases where the service outcome depends on user-provided information or external platform limitations beyond our control.</p>
          <p>If a refund is approved after verification, the amount will be processed back to the original payment method within 2–5 business days, subject to the policies and processing timelines of the respective payment gateway or financial institution.</p>
          <p>Any transaction charges, platform fees, or payment gateway charges, if applicable, are non-refundable.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>Cancellation Policy</h2>
          <p>Cancellations are permitted only if the request is made within 3 days of placing the order and before the digital service has been delivered, activated, or accessed.</p>
          <p>Once a digital service has been initiated, processed, delivered, or access credentials / reports / insights have been shared with the user, cancellation requests will not be accepted.</p>
          <p>Cancellation requests must be submitted through the official support channels provided on the Platform. Each request will be reviewed to verify the status of service delivery before approval.</p>
          <p>If a cancellation is approved, any eligible refund will be processed in accordance with the Refund Policy and credited back to the original payment method within 2–5 business days, subject to payment gateway processing timelines.</p>
          <p>The Platform Owner reserves the right to reject cancellation requests that do not meet the above conditions or where misuse or abuse of the policy is suspected.</p>
