          limitations, and procedures governing refunds, cancellations, and
          disputes for purchases made on this website. By completing a payment

          <h2>1. Nature of Products and Services</h2>
          <p>
            All products and/or services offered on this website are digital,
            online, instant-access, or non-physical services, unless explicitly
            mentioned otherwise on the respective product page.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once access credentials, reports, dashboards, tools, digital files,
            or services are delivered or made accessible, the order is deemed
            successfully delivered and fulfilled.
          </p>
          <p>Digital services, once delivered, cannot be returned.</p>

          <h2>2. Refund Eligibility</h2>
          <p>
            Refunds are not automatic and are not guaranteed. All refund
            requests are reviewed strictly on a case-by-case basis.
          </p>
          <p>A refund may be considered only under the following conditions:</p>

            <li>
              The customer was charged more than once for the same transaction.
            </li>
            <li>
              The customer did not receive access to the purchased service due
              to a verified technical failure on our end.
            </li>
            <li>
              The delivered service is materially different from what was
              clearly described on the website at the time of purchase.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If none of the above conditions are met, the refund request will be
            rejected.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">

          <h2>4. Refund Amount & Figures</h2>
          <p>If a refund request is approved:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The refund amount will be limited strictly to the amount paid by
              the customer.
            </li>
            <li>
              This may include ₹99 (Rupees Ninety-Nine Only) or any other amount
              actually paid, depending on the transaction.
            </li>
            <li>
              No refund will exceed the original payment amount under any
              circumstances.
            </li>
            <li>
              No additional compensation, interest, damages, or penalties will
              be provided.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
