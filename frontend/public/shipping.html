        <p style="font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 30px">
          Last updated: 26 December 2025
        </p>
        <p>
          This Shipping Policy explains how orders are processed and delivered
          when a purchase is made on this website. By placing an order, you
          agree to the terms outlined below.
        </p>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>1. Order Processing</h2>
          <p>All orders are processed after successful payment confirmation.</p>
          <p>
            Order processing typically begins within 24–48 hours of purchase.
            Orders are not processed or delivered on weekends or public holidays
            unless otherwise stated.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we experience a high volume of orders, processing times may be
            slightly delayed. Customers will be notified in case of any
            significant delay.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>2. Delivery Timeframes</h2>
          <p>
            Estimated delivery timelines may vary depending on factors such as:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Order volume</li>
            <li>Location</li>
            <li>Operational or technical considerations</li>
            <li>External service providers</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Delivery timelines provided at checkout or on the website are
            estimates only and not guaranteed.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>3. Delivery Method</h2>
          <p>
            Orders are fulfilled using appropriate delivery methods as
            determined by the company. Delivery may be handled directly by us or
            through third-party service providers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once an order is processed and dispatched, responsibility for
            delivery timelines may depend on the selected method or service
            provider.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>4. Shipping Charges</h2>

          <p>
            Any additional charges imposed by third-party providers, banks, or
            service partners are beyond our control.

          <h2>6. Delays &amp; Issues</h2>

            fails due to factors outside our control, customers must contact us
            within 24 hours of the expected delivery date for assistance.
          </p>
          <p>Each case will be reviewed individually.</p>
